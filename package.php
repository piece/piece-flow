"Action Continuation" is a very important feature for developers. This feature will allow developers to write linear code in an action via the properties without using flow attributes. This means that the programming be nearer natural continuation programming, although it is limited the scope in the action.

See the following release notes for details.

## Enhancements ##

### Piece_Flow_Continuation, Piece_Flow_Action_Factory ###

- Added a feature to store the action instances as a flow attribute in a flow execution, and restore the action instances when continuing the flow execution. (Ticket #13)

### Piece_Flow_Action_Factory ###

- Added clearInstances() to clear all instances of actions. (Ticket #12)';
